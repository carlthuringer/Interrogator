Birthday Questionnaire
======================

A project started by a friend, this is an application that asks a series
of questions and then confirms your answers.

Running:
start an IRB session and ```load './birthday_recursive.rb'``` then call
Birthday.interrogate!

Testing:
There's a guardfile so if you get the ```guard``` gem you can just type
```guard``` to run the spec.
